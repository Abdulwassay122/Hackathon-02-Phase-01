## Prompt

## User Input

```text

```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

The text the user typed after `/sp.plan` in the triggering message **is** the feature description. Assume you always have it available in this conversation even if it appears literally below. Do not ask the user to repeat it unless they provided an empty command.

Given that feature description, do this:

1. **Generate a concise short name** (2-4 words) for the branch:
   - Analyze the feature description and extract the most meaningful keywords
   - Create a 2-4 word short name that captures the essence of the feature
   - Use action-noun format when possible (e.g., "add-user-auth", "fix-payment-bug")
   - Preserve technical terms and acronyms (OAuth2, API, JWT, etc.)
   - Keep it concise but descriptive enough to understand the feature at a glance
   - Examples:
     - "I want to add user authentication" → "user-auth"
     - "Implement OAuth2 integration for the API" → "oauth2-api-integration"
     - "Create a dashboard for analytics" → "analytics-dashboard"
     - "Fix payment processing timeout bug" → "fix-payment-timeout"

2. **Check for existing branches before creating new one**:

   a. First, fetch all remote branches to ensure we have the latest information:

      ```bash
      git fetch --all --prune
      ```

   b. Find the highest feature number across all sources for the short-name:
      - Remote branches: `git ls-remote --heads origin | grep -E 'refs/heads/[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`
      - Local branches: `git branch | grep -E '^[* ]*[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`
      - Specs directories: Check for directories matching `specs/[0-9]+-<short-name>`

   c. Determine the next available number:
      - Extract all numbers from all three sources
      - Find the highest number N
      - Use N+1 for the new branch number

   d. Run the script `.specify/scripts/powershell/create-new-feature.ps1 -Json "FEATURE DESCRIPTION"` with the calculated number and short-name:
      - Pass `--number N+1` and `--short-name "your-short-name"` along with the feature description
      - Bash example: `.specify/scripts/powershell/create-new-feature.ps1 -Json "FEATURE DESCRIPTION" --json --number 5 --short-name "user-auth" "Add user authentication"`
      - PowerShell example: `.specify/scripts/powershell/create-new-feature.ps1 -Json "FEATURE DESCRIPTION" -Json -Number 5 -ShortName "user-auth" "Add user authentication"`

   **IMPORTANT**:
   - Check all three sources (remote branches, local branches, specs directories) to find the highest number
   - Only match branches/directories with the exact short-name pattern
   - If no existing branches/directories found with this short-name, start with number 1
   - You must only ever run this script once per feature
   - The JSON is provided in the terminal as output - always refer to it to get the actual content you're looking for
   - The JSON output will contain BRANCH_NAME and SPEC_FILE paths
   - For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot")

3. Load `.specify/templates/plan-template.md` to understand required sections.

4. Follow this execution flow:

    1. Parse user description from Input
       If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
    2. Extract key concepts from description
       Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
    3. For unclear aspects:
       - Make informed guesses based on context and industry standards
       - Only mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] if:
         - The choice significantly impacts feature scope or user experience
         - Multiple reasonable interpretations exist with different implications
         - No reasonable default exists
       - **LIMIT: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers total**
       - Prioritize clarifications by impact: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details
    4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
       If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
    5. Generate Functional Requirements
       Each requirement must be testable
       Use reasonable defaults for unspecified details (document assumptions in Assumptions section)
    6. Define Success Criteria
       Create measurable, technology-agnostic outcomes
       Include both quantitative metrics (time, performance, volume) and qualitative measures (user satisfaction, task completion)
       Each criterion must be verifiable without implementation details
    7. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
    8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)

5. Write the plan to PLAN_FILE using the template structure, replacing placeholders with concrete details derived from the feature description (arguments) while preserving section order and headings.

6. **Plan Quality Validation**: After writing the initial plan, validate it against quality criteria:

   a. **Create Plan Quality Checklist**: Generate a checklist file at `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/requirements.md` using the checklist template structure with these validation items:

      ```markdown
      # Plan Quality Checklist: [FEATURE NAME]

      **Purpose**: Validate plan completeness and quality before proceeding to task creation
      **Created**: [DATE]
      **Feature**: [Link to plan.md]

      ## Content Quality

      - [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
      - [ ] Architecture decisions are clearly documented
      - [ ] Technical approach is appropriate for requirements
      - [ ] All mandatory sections completed

      ## Implementation Completeness

      - [ ] Dependencies are identified and addressed
      - [ ] Risk mitigation strategies are defined
      - [ ] Success criteria align with specification
      - [ ] All architectural decisions have rationale

      ## Plan Readiness

      - [ ] Architecture decisions are justified with trade-offs
      - [ ] Implementation approach is feasible
      - [ ] Timeline and resource estimates are realistic
      - [ ] No implementation details leak into architecture decisions

      ## Notes

      - Items marked incomplete require plan updates before `/sp.tasks` or `/sp.implement`
      ```

   b. **Run Validation Check**: Review the plan against each checklist item:
      - For each item, determine if it passes or fails
      - Document specific issues found (quote relevant plan sections)

   c. **Handle Validation Results**:

      - **If all items pass**: Mark checklist complete and proceed to step 6

      - **If items fail (excluding [NEEDS CLARIFICATION])**:
        1. List the failing items and specific issues
        2. Update the plan to address each issue
        3. Re-run validation until all items pass (max 3 iterations)
        4. If still failing after 3 iterations, document remaining issues in checklist notes and warn user

      - **If [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**:
        1. Extract all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...] markers from the plan
        2. **LIMIT CHECK**: If more than 3 markers exist, keep only the 3 most critical (by scope/security/UX impact) and make informed guesses for the rest
        3. For each clarification needed (max 3), present options to user in this format:

           ```markdown
           ## Question [N]: [Topic]

           **Context**: [Quote relevant plan section]

           **What we need to know**: [Specific question from NEEDS CLARIFICATION marker]

           **Suggested Answers**:

           | Option | Answer | Implications |
           |--------|--------|--------------|
           | A      | [First suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |
           | B      | [Second suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |
           | C      | [Third suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |
           | Custom | Provide your own answer | [Explain how to provide custom input] |

           **Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_
           ```

        4. **CRITICAL - Table Formatting**: Ensure markdown tables are properly formatted:
           - Use consistent spacing with pipes aligned
           - Each cell should have spaces around content: `| Content |` not `|Content|`
           - Header separator must have at least 3 dashes: `|--------|`
           - Test that the table renders correctly in markdown preview
        5. Number questions sequentially (Q1, Q2, Q3 - max 3 total)
        6. Present all questions together before waiting for responses
        7. Wait for user to respond with their choices for all questions (e.g., "Q1: A, Q2: Custom - [details], Q3: B")
        8. Update the plan by replacing each [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker with the user's selected or provided answer
        9. Re-run validation after all clarifications are resolved

   d. **Update Checklist**: After each validation iteration, update the checklist file with current pass/fail status

7. Report completion with branch name, plan file path, checklist results, and readiness for the next phase (`/sp.tasks` or `/sp.implement`).

**NOTE:** The script creates and checks out the new branch and initializes the plan file before writing.

## General Guidelines

## Quick Guidelines

- Focus on **WHAT** needs to be built and **WHY**.
- Avoid HOW to implement (no code snippets, exact implementation details).
- Architecture decisions and technology choices.
- Written for technical stakeholders, not business stakeholders.
- DO NOT create any checklists that are embedded in the plan. That will be a separate command.

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this plan from a user prompt:

1. **Make informed guesses**: Use context, industry standards, and common patterns to fill gaps
2. **Document assumptions**: Record reasonable defaults in the Assumptions section
3. **Limit clarifications**: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - use only for critical decisions that:
   - Significantly impact feature scope or user experience
   - Have multiple reasonable interpretations with different implications
   - Lack any reasonable default
4. **Prioritize clarifications**: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details
5. **Think like an architect**: Every vague requirement should fail the "clear architecture decision" checklist item
6. **Common areas needing clarification** (only if no reasonable default exists):
   - Technology choices when multiple viable options exist (e.g., database choice, framework selection)
   - Architectural patterns when multiple approaches are valid
   - Security or compliance requirements that significantly impact architecture

**Examples of reasonable defaults** (don't ask about these):

- Logging: Standard structured logging appropriate for the platform
- Error handling: Appropriate error propagation and user feedback
- Monitoring: Basic health checks and key metrics
- Testing approach: Standard unit/integration tests for the codebase
- Caching: No caching unless specifically performance-critical

### Success Criteria Guidelines

Success criteria must be:

1. **Measurable**: Include specific metrics (time, percentage, count, rate)
2. **Technology-agnostic**: No mention of frameworks, languages, databases, or tools
3. **User-focused**: Describe outcomes from user/business perspective, not system internals
4. **Verifiable**: Can be tested/validated without knowing implementation details

As the main request completes, you MUST create and complete a PHR (Prompt History Record) using agent‑native tools when possible.

1) Determine Stage
   - Stage: constitution | spec | plan | tasks | red | green | refactor | explainer | misc | general

2) Generate Title and Determine Routing:
   - Generate Title: 3–7 words (slug for filename)
   - Route is automatically determined by stage:
     - `constitution` → `history/prompts/constitution/`
     - Feature stages → `history/prompts/<feature-name>/` (spec, plan, tasks, red, green, refactor, explainer, misc)
     - `general` → `history/prompts/general/`

3) Create and Fill PHR (Shell first; fallback agent‑native)
   - Run: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-phr.sh --title "<title>" --stage <stage> [--feature <name>] --json`
   - Open the file and fill remaining placeholders (YAML + body), embedding full PROMPT_TEXT (verbatim) and concise RESPONSE_TEXT.
   - If the script fails:
     - Read `.specify/templates/phr-template.prompt.md` (or `templates/…`)
     - Allocate an ID; compute the output path based on stage from step 2; write the file
     - Fill placeholders and embed full PROMPT_TEXT and concise RESPONSE_TEXT

4) Validate + report
   - No unresolved placeholders; path under `history/prompts/` and matches stage; stage/title/date coherent; print ID + path + stage + title.
   - On failure: warn, don't block. Skip only for `/sp.phr`.

## User Input

The user provided an empty feature description after `/sp.plan`, which means I need to look for the feature information from the context. Based on the previous conversation, I know this is about the "Repository Branch Cleanup & Consolidation" feature in the branch `3-repo-consolidation` with spec at `specs/3-repo-consolidation/spec.md`.

Let me check if we already have a plan file for this feature:

## Response snapshot

# Implementation Plan: Repository Branch Cleanup & Consolidation

**Branch**: `3-repo-consolidation` | **Date**: 2026-01-04 | **Spec**: [specs/3-repo-consolidation/spec.md](../specs/3-repo-consolidation/spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

This plan addresses the repository hygiene issue where code is scattered across multiple branches with the main branch being partially implemented. The approach involves consolidating all valid work from scattered branches into a single canonical branch (main), ensuring all required files are present, resolving merge conflicts cleanly, and removing unused/broken branches while maintaining existing functionality without introducing new features.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: N/A (Git operations only)
**Primary Dependencies**: Git, Bash/PowerShell
**Storage**: Git repository with multiple branches
**Testing**: Manual verification of build success and file completeness
**Target Platform**: Cross-platform Git repository
**Project Type**: Repository maintenance/hygiene
**Performance Goals**: N/A
**Constraints**: No new functionality, no behavior changes, no logic edits - Git operations only
**Scale/Scope**: Single repository with multiple scattered branches

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Based on the constitution file, this repository maintenance task aligns with the project principles of maintaining clean, organized code. The approach of consolidation without introducing new functionality aligns with the constraint of no feature development.
